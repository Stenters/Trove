  * Welcome to the crew!

  * Makes sense, we are trying to find a way to get you out, but have not been able to find this genie. For now, is there any thing we can bring you?
  * I am keen for a game of dragonchess
  * *Go to armoire, pull out dragonchess set, see what's new in the bottle*
  * *Talk about new ship, not nearly as fast or pretty, show charts to Corvenus*
* Sal to crew
  * What does everyone want? *Looks at Kinu*
  * I came from small village, maybe want to see what else is out there. Didn't have piracy in mind
  * Were disturbed when Jhim Gold mentioned dragons
  * Met one, back in the village. Dragon guardians in trove, guard where the land, air, and sea all meet. Sometimes ppl get nosey, sometimes dragon lives with keeper, other people want  to poke around, kill them, stuff like that. Instinctual distrust of *meddlers*
